# etch-a-sketch

The goal of this project was to utilise my newley acquired knowledge of the DOM, and how to manipulate it.

The current state of this project is all that is needed for the TOP Project, however I will revisit it to make
the below changes in the future:

-Keep the current state of the etch-a-sketch as the default mode but add two more modes as well:
    -Random colour mode
    -Custom colour mode
-Add a new method of getting user input for grid size
-Change the drawing method from mouse hover to mouseclick+drag
